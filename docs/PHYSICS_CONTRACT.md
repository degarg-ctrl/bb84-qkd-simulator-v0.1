# BB84 QKD Simulator â Physics Ground Truth
All simulation code must conform exactly to this document.
Any deviation is a bug, not a design choice.

## 1. Basis System
Two bases: Rectilinear (+) and Diagonal (x)
Alice and Bob each choose basis randomly, probability 0.5 each.
Basis match probability 0.5 â sifting retains ~50% of raw bits.

## 2. Polarization Encoding
Basis | Bit | State | Angle
+     |  0  | |0>   |   0 degrees
+     |  1  | |1>   |  90 degrees
x     |  0  | |+>   |  45 degrees
x     |  1  | |->   | 135 degrees

## 3. Measurement Rules
Correct basis: Bob measures Alice's bit perfectly.
Wrong basis: Bob gets random bit, equal probability 0 or 1.
Only error source in noiseless no-Eve scenario.

## 4. Channel Model
loss_dB   = ATTENUATION_COEFF * distance_km
P_survive = 10^(-loss_dB / 10)
P_detect  = P_survive * eta + P_dark * (1 - P_survive * eta)

## 5. Eve Intercept-Resend
Eve intercepts each photon with probability attack_prob.
Eve picks random basis, measures, re-emits in measured state.
Eve basis != Alice basis: 50% chance Bob gets wrong bit.
attack_prob = 1.0 â QBER contribution = 0.25 exactly.
attack_prob = p   â QBER contribution = 0.25 * p.
Eve QBER and channel noise QBER are cumulative.

## 6. QBER
Sample 10% of sifted bits. Sampled bits discarded from final key.
QBER = erroneous_bits / total_sampled_sifted_bits
QBER >= 0.11 â SKR = 0, session aborted, threshold_breached = True

## 7. SKR
H(Q) = -Q*log2(Q) - (1-Q)*log2(1-Q)
R    = S * (1 - 2 * H(Q))
QBER >= 0.11: R = 0 unconditionally

## 8. Validation Benchmarks
No Eve, 0km, noise=0.00 â QBER ~0%
No Eve, 0km, noise=0.05 â QBER ~5%
Eve attack_prob=1.0     â QBER ~25%
Eve attack_prob=0.5     â QBER ~12.5%
distance=50km           â P_survive ~10%
distance=100km          â P_survive ~1%

## 9. Authoritative Constants
ATTENUATION_COEFF_DB_PER_KM = 0.2
DETECTOR_EFFICIENCY         = 0.85
DARK_COUNT_PROB             = 1e-5
QBER_SECURITY_THRESHOLD     = 0.11
SAMPLE_FRACTION_FOR_QBER    = 0.10

## 10. Quantum Gate Transformations
Applied to photon polarization states per lane in order.
Gates are applied AFTER channel transmission, BEFORE Bob measures.

H (Hadamard):
  |0> ? |+>  (0° ? 45°)
  |1> ? |->  (90° ? 135°)
  |+> ? |0>  (45° ? 0°)
  |-> ? |1>  (135° ? 90°)

X (Pauli-X / Bit-flip):
  |0> ? |1>  (0° ? 90°)
  |1> ? |0>  (90° ? 0°)
  |+> ? |+>  (45° ? 45°, invariant)
  |-> ? |->  (135° ? 135°, invariant)

Z (Pauli-Z / Phase-flip):
  |0> ? |0>  (0° unchanged)
  |1> ? |1>  (90° unchanged, global phase only)
  |+> ? |->  (45° ? 135°)
  |-> ? |+>  (135° ? 45°)

Y (Pauli-Y / Bit+Phase flip):
  |0> ? |1>  (0° ? 90°)
  |1> ? |0>  (90° ? 0°)
  |+> ? |->  (45° ? 135°)
  |-> ? |+>  (135° ? 45°)

S (Phase gate p/2):
  |0> ? |0>  (unchanged)
  |1> ? |1>  (phase only  visual: photon color tint +15°)
  |+> ? polarization_angle += 22.5°
  |-> ? polarization_angle -= 22.5°

T (Phase gate p/4):
  |0> ? |0>  (unchanged)
  |1> ? |1>  (phase only  visual: photon color tint +8°)
  |+> ? polarization_angle += 11.25°
  |-> ? polarization_angle -= 11.25°

Gate application rule:
  - Gates apply only to photons on the matching lane
  - Multiple gates on same lane apply left to right
  - Gate transformations update both 'bit', 'basis', 
    'state_label' and 'polarization_angle' fields
  - 'alice_bit' and 'alice_basis' are NEVER modified by gates

## 11. No-Cloning Theorem (Exp 6)
A quantum state cannot be perfectly duplicated.
Eve cloning attempt via CNOT entanglement:
  Input:  |psi>|0>  original photon + blank probe qubit
  Output: entangled state  neither copy equals |psi>
  QBER impact: adds ~25% error above channel baseline
  Visual: lane color shifts red after Cloning Probe position
          affected photon polarization_angle randomized
          Bob receives degraded state

## 12. Single Photon Mode
  n_bits = 1 triggers single photon transmission mode
  Full pipeline applies to exactly 1 photon
  QBER estimation skipped  insufficient sample size
  Result includes step-by-step photon journey log:
    - Alice encoding
    - Channel survival/loss
    - Eve interception (if active)
    - Bob measurement
    - Basis match result

## 13. One-Time Pad (OTP) Encryption
The BB84 sifted key is used as a one-time pad key.
XOR encryption: C = M XOR K (ciphertext = message XOR key)
XOR decryption: M = C XOR K (identical operation)
Perfect secrecy conditions (Shannon, 1949):
  1. Key must be truly random - BB84 guarantees this
  2. Key must be used only once - enforced by resetting
  3. Key must be at least as long as the message
  4. Key must be secret - BB84 key exchange guarantees this
ASCII encoding: each character = 8 bits
Maximum message length = floor(sifted_key_bits / 8)
## 14. Weak Coherent Pulse (WCP) Model
Real photon sources emit Poisson-distributed photon numbers.
Ideal single-photon sources do not exist in practice.
Laser pulses attenuated to mean photon number mu (mu).

Poisson distribution:
  P(n|mu) = e^(-mu) * mu^n / n!
  where n = number of photons in pulse, mu = mean photon number

Typical values:
  mu = 0.1 -> P(0)=90.5%, P(1)=9.0%, P(2+)=0.5%
  mu = 0.2 -> P(0)=81.9%, P(1)=16.4%, P(2+)=1.8%
  mu = 0.5 -> P(0)=60.7%, P(1)=30.3%, P(2+)=9.0%

Default simulator value: mu = 0.2
Configurable range: 0.05 to 0.5

Multi-photon probability (PNS vulnerability):
  P(n>=2|mu) = 1 - e^(-mu) - mu*e^(-mu)
  At mu=0.2: P(multi) ~ 1.75%

WCP effect on SKR:
  Effective single-photon rate: S_wcp = S * mu * e^(-mu)
  Multi-photon fraction increases PNS vulnerability

## 15. PNS Attack (Photon Number Splitting)
Exploits multi-photon pulses in WCP sources.
Eve performs Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) measurement
to count photons without measuring polarization.

Attack procedure:
  Single-photon pulses (n=1):
    Eve blocks with probability p_block
    Bob sees increased channel loss
  Multi-photon pulses (n>=2):
    Eve splits one photon, stores in quantum memory
    Forwards remaining photons to Bob via lossless channel
    After basis reconciliation: Eve measures in correct basis

Critical property: QBER ~ 0% -- UNDETECTABLE by threshold
Eve gains complete information on split photons.

Detection: ONLY via decoy state protocol (Section 16)
Standard 11% QBER threshold CANNOT detect PNS attack.

Simulation parameters:
  p_block: probability Eve blocks single-photon pulses (0-1)
  p_split: probability Eve splits multi-photon pulses (0-1)
  Eve's information gain: p_split * P(n>=2|mu) / total_bits

SKR under PNS attack:
  R_pns = S * (1 - 2*H(Q)) - leaked_information
  leaked_information = p_split * P(n>=2|mu)
  If leaked_information >= R_pns: session compromised

## 16. Decoy State Protocol
Countermeasure against PNS attack.
Alice randomly sends pulses with different mean photon numbers.

Three intensity levels:
  Signal states:  mu_s = 0.5  (most pulses)
  Decoy states:   mu_d = 0.1  (random subset ~20%)
  Vacuum states:  mu_v = 0.0  (random subset ~10%)

Detection principle:
  Gain Q_mu: fraction of pulses Bob detects at intensity mu
  Under PNS: Q_signal >> Q_decoy (Eve blocks more singles)
  Under normal: Q_signal ~ Q_decoy * (mu_s/mu_d)

PNS detected when:
  |Q_signal/mu_s - Q_decoy/mu_d| > epsilon (threshold 0.05)
